# Yondle 🧭

A daily, mobile-first **geography guessing game**. Every day, everyone in the world
gets the **same** puzzle: one **start city** and one **target distance**. Your job is
to name a real city that lies as close as possible to that exact distance from the
start — measured as the great-circle (haversine) distance. You get **6 guesses**.

> **Project status:** v1 is complete — the pure, tested game core (distance/bearing,
> dataset + fuzzy autocomplete, deterministic generator, scoring, engine, share, stats)
> **and** the React UI (guess loop, hot/cold feedback, result, stats, onboarding, light
>
> - dark). Fully static; deploys to Vercel. `npm run dev` to play.

## How it works

| Rule            | Value                                                                  | Where                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Guesses per day | **6**                                                                  | `rules.guesses`                    |
| Win band        | best guess within **±5%** of target                                    | `rules.tolerancePct`               |
| Score           | `1000 × max(0, 1 − error/0.5)` on best guess **+ 50 per unused guess** | `rules.score`                      |
| Target distance | **200–2000 km**, validated to have ≥3 valid answers                    | `rules.target`, `rules.generation` |
| Start city      | population-weighted, **≥ 1,000,000** (recognizable)                    | `rules.startCity`                  |
| Dataset         | GeoNames cities, **pop ≥ 100k** (~6.2k cities)                         | `rules.dataset`                    |
| Daily reset     | **UTC midnight**, seeded from the date                                 | `rules.reset`                      |

**Win vs. score are two layers over the same number** — a guess's _percent error_ is
`|guessDistance − target| ÷ target`.

- **Win/lose (drives the streak):** you win if your best guess lands inside the ±5%
  band. For a 1000 km target that's 950–1050 km. It's unit-independent — the same in
  km or miles.
- **Score (bragging rights):** how _deep_ inside you got — full points at a perfect
  hit, decaying smoothly to 0 once you're 50% off, plus a bonus for finishing in fewer
  guesses.

### Per-guess feedback

After each guess you see the guessed city's actual distance from the start, the delta
from target ("142 km too far" / "37 km too close"), the **compass direction + an
arrow** (e.g. `NE ↗`), and a hot→cold colour cue by percent error. A **globe** centred
on the start city plots every guess with a great-circle arc — so you can see, at a
glance, which direction to steer (guesses on the far side of the world fall "over the
horizon"). A km/mi toggle switches all displayed distances (the win band is a
percentage, so it's identical either way).

### End of round

On a win or after 6 guesses, Yondle reveals the **3 closest possible** answer cities
and your best delta, and the globe now also **marks the answer cities** (hidden during
play so they can't be a spoiler) — the "here's where you actually wandered" payoff. A
Wordle-style shareable summary (hot/cold squares and direction arrows, no city names)
copies to the clipboard.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # Vite dev server → http://localhost:5173
npm test             # Vitest pure-logic suites
npm run lint         # ESLint (flat config)
npm run typecheck    # tsc, strict
npm run build        # production build → dist/
npm run data:build   # regenerate src/data/cities.json from ./data-src
npm run preview:puzzles   # print generated puzzles for several dates
```

Peek at the deterministic generator (same for everyone on that date):

```
2026-07-15  START: Baotou       TARGET: 607 km   band 577–637   valid answers: many
            closest: Linshui 604 km (−3), Handan 604 km, Guyuan 603 km ...
```

```

The core is intentionally **pure and data-driven** so puzzles can later be
precomputed server-side and the game can grow additional modes / multiplayer without
rewrites. See `CLAUDE.md` for architecture notes and `DECISIONS.md` for the rationale
behind each rule.

## Data & deployment

City data © [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/), licensed **CC BY 4.0**. The
reveal globe's coastlines come from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/)
(public domain) via the bundled `world-atlas` 110m land data — no map tiles, no CDN.
The compact `cities.json` is committed, so the app is fully static — it deploys to
**Vercel** (framework preset **Vite**, build command `npm run build`, output
`dist/`) with no backend.

## Tech

React + Vite + TypeScript, ESLint + Prettier, Vitest, GitHub Actions CI. The reveal
globe uses `d3-geo` (orthographic projection) + `world-atlas` land data, code-split and
lazy-loaded so they stay out of the initial bundle.
